## What is OE_Hello_World?
OE_hello_world is a silly idea I had about a way I could learn more about the process and craft of making and deploying modern websites.

The idea is to take an extremely basic website that literally just says "Hello, World" and progressively add complexity to it over time in a slow and delibrate fashion to give myself the opportunity to learn more about the vast amount of stuff that goes into even a realitively simple modern website. 

## The plan
My plan is to have each PR I merge to main progessively increase the websites complexity from the perspective of the website itself and not necessarily from the perspective of me, the developer. For example it is actually quite trivial to spin up a project that uses Astro, Next.js, Nuxt, etc. but those tools immediately increase the number of files involved in a website dramatically while the developer experience stays relatively straight forward. 

I want to push my website as far as I can in terms of complexity without reaching for modern abstraction layers until I absolutely need them specifically to force myself to encounter the numerous limits of my current knowledge around building websites. I plan to do this both within the code for the website itself as well as the deployment of the website so I can learn more about the process top to bottom. 

I plan to do write ups about how this process goes periodically on my website which you can read [here](https://chrispohlman.com/garden).
